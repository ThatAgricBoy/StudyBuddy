Import the required modules: tkinter, math, and winsound.
Define some constants: PINK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, FONT_NAME, WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, LONG_BREAK_MIN, reps, and timer.
Define a function play_sound() to play a notification sound using the winsound module.
Define a function reset_timer() to reset the timer. It cancels any existing timer, resets the timer text to "00:00", sets the title label to "Timer", clears the check marks, and resets the reps counter to 0.
Define a function start_timer() to start the timer. It increments the reps counter by 1 and calculates the durations for work, short break, and long break periods.
Inside start_timer(), based on the value of reps, it calls the count_down() function with the appropriate duration and updates the title label to "Work", "Break", or "Break" with the corresponding color.
Define a function count_down(count) to perform the countdown. It takes a count in seconds and updates the timer text on the canvas with the minutes and seconds. If the count is greater than 0, it schedules the function to be called again after 1 second using the after() method. If the count reaches 0, it calls start_timer() again to continue the cycle, updates the check marks based on the number of completed work sessions, and plays a notification sound.
Set up the UI using the tkinter module. Create a window with the title "Pomodoro Technique" and set the padding and background color.
Create and configure various labels, buttons, and canvas elements for the UI layout.
Associate the start_timer() and reset_timer() functions with the respective buttons' command attribute.
Run the application using the mainloop() method.
